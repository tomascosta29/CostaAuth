Here's a comprehensive architecture proposal for your authentication microservice:

---

## 1. Overview

The auth microservice will be an independent HTTP service responsible for handling all authentication tasks such as user login, token issuance, token validation, token refresh, and logout/force logout (via token revocation). It will be designed to scale independently and interact with other services through clearly defined APIs. 

---

## 2. Core Components

- **HTTP API Server**: The entry point that exposes endpoints over HTTPS.
- **Token Manager**: Responsible for issuing, validating, and refreshing tokens (e.g., JWTs). This module encapsulates the logic for signing, verifying, and parsing tokens.
- **User Management Module**: Handles user registration, credential validation, and possibly password resets.
- **Data Store**: A database for storing user credentials (using hashed passwords) and, optionally, session or token blacklist information (Redis is a common choice for fast lookups).
- **Audit & Logging**: For recording authentication events (logins, failed attempts, token revocations) which is critical for security monitoring.
- **Optional Security Enhancements**: Modules for MFA, rate limiting, and integration with SoftHSM for managing crypto materials.

## 3. HTTP Endpoints

### **User-Facing Endpoints**

1. **POST /auth/register**
   - **Purpose**: Register a new user.
   - **Input**: JSON payload (e.g., `{ "username": "jdoe", "email": "jdoe@example.com", "password": "secret" }`).
   - **Output**: Confirmation message or user profile (without sensitive details).
   - **Notes**: Implement input validation, rate limiting, and optionally email verification.

2. **POST /auth/login**
   - **Purpose**: Authenticate a user and issue tokens.
   - **Input**: JSON payload with credentials (e.g., `{ "username": "jdoe", "password": "secret" }`).
   - **Output**: JSON response containing an access token (and refresh token if applicable).
   - **Flow**: Validate credentials, then generate a JWT that includes claims (e.g., user id, roles, expiration). Optionally include MFA challenges.

3. **POST /auth/refresh**
   - **Purpose**: Issue a new access token using a valid refresh token.
   - **Input**: JSON payload with the refresh token.
   - **Output**: A new access token (and possibly a new refresh token).
   - **Notes**: Verify that the refresh token hasn't been revoked or blacklisted.

4. **POST /auth/logout**
   - **Purpose**: Log out the user by invalidating the token.
   - **Input**: The token to be invalidated can be passed via the Authorization header or in the body.
   - **Output**: A confirmation message.
   - **Flow**: Add the token’s unique identifier (e.g., `jti` claim) to a blacklist with an expiration matching the token’s expiry.

5. **GET /auth/validate**
   - **Purpose**: Validate a token’s authenticity.
   - **Input**: Token provided in the Authorization header or as a query parameter.
   - **Output**: JSON response indicating if the token is valid along with token claims (or an error message).
   - **Usage**: This endpoint can be used internally by other services or for client-side validation.

### **Admin / Management Endpoints**

1. **POST /auth/admin/revoke**
   - **Purpose**: Force logout or revoke tokens (e.g., by an admin action).
   - **Input**: JSON payload specifying either the user ID or the token identifier (`jti`).
   - **Output**: A success message confirming the token(s) have been revoked.
   - **Flow**: Update the token blacklist accordingly.

---

## 4. Authentication Flow

1. **Login Process**:  
   - The client sends credentials to **/auth/login**.
   - The service validates the credentials against the user data store.
   - On success, a JWT is issued with a set expiration and unique token identifier.
   - The JWT is returned to the client, who then uses it for subsequent requests.

2. **Token Usage and Validation**:  
   - Clients include the token in the Authorization header (Bearer token) when making API calls.
   - Each service can call **/auth/validate** or perform local token validation using shared secrets/public keys.
   - This ensures that tokens are valid, not expired, and not blacklisted.

3. **Token Refresh**:  
   - When an access token is nearing expiry, the client calls **/auth/refresh** with the refresh token.
   - The service validates the refresh token and issues a new access token.

4. **Logout / Token Revocation**:  
   - A logout request via **/auth/logout** triggers the addition of the token’s identifier to a blacklist.
   - For force logout (via admin action), **/auth/admin/revoke** can be used to revoke active tokens.

---

## 5. Security Considerations

- **HTTPS Only**: All communications must occur over HTTPS to protect data in transit.
- **mTLS** is mandatory: Mutual authentication is essential for internal connection between Auth microservice and API handler.
- **Secure Token Management**: Use strong signing algorithms (HS256 for symmetric or RS256 for asymmetric keys) and proper token expiration policies.
- **Password Handling**: Securely hash passwords using algorithms like bcrypt or scrypt.
- **SoftHSM Integration**:  
  - Use SoftHSM during development to emulate an HSM for secure key storage.
  - This abstraction allows you to easily swap to a real HSM later without major changes to your code.
- **Rate Limiting & Logging**: Protect endpoints from brute force attacks and maintain audit logs for security incidents.

---

## 6. Extensibility and Best Practices

- **API Versioning**: Use versioned endpoints (e.g., `/v1/auth/login`) to facilitate future changes without breaking clients.
- **Client Library**: Consider developing a Go client library that wraps the HTTP calls for easier integration with other services.
- **Service Discovery**: If deployed in a larger microservices architecture, incorporate service discovery (e.g., via Kubernetes or Consul) and API gateways to route calls securely.
- **Modular Design**: Keep each component (e.g., token management, user management, database access) modular. This aids in testing, maintenance, and swapping out components (such as replacing SoftHSM with a real HSM).

---

## Summary

This proposed architecture for your authentication microservice covers:
- **User registration, login, token issuance, validation, refresh, and logout endpoints.**
- **A clear flow for handling authentication with JWTs and optional token revocation via blacklisting.**
- **Security practices** like HTTPS, proper password hashing, and token management with the ability to integrate SoftHSM.
- **Extensibility** through API versioning, modular design, and potential client libraries.

This setup provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for your DocuSign-like project while allowing you to extend or modify components as your requirements evolve.
